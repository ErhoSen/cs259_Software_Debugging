# Software Debugging
## Automating the Boring Tasks

### Course Summary
In this class you will learn how to debug programs systematically, how to automate the debugging process and build several automated debugging tools in Python.

## Syllabus

### Lesson 1: How Debuggers work

Theory: Scientific method and its application to debugging. 

Fun fact: First bug in the history of computer science. 

Practice: Building a simple tracer.

### Lesson 2: Asserting Expectations

Theory: Assertions in testing and in debugging. 

Fun fact: The most expensive bug in history. 

Practice: Improving the tracer.

### Lesson 3: Simplifying Failures
